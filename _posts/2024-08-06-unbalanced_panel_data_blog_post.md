title: Resample unbalanced (panel) datasets in Pandas fast
description: Pandas by default assumes that consecutive observations in a panel dataset are consecutive dates. This is not the case for unbalanced panel datasets, where units don't need to appear for in every period. This creates problems when calculating a ``.diff()`` or ``.shift()``. One solution is to resample the missing observations. This posts provides a fast resampling method that supports periods that aren't a fixed unit of time such as months.

Working with panel data can be challenging, particularly when the data is unbalanced, meaning the observations do not occur at regular intervals. This irregularity poses a problem when applying operations like `.diff()` or `.shift()`, as Pandas assumes consecutive observations correspond to consecutive time periods. Without a fixed periodicity, calculating differences or shifts correctly becomes difficult. To address this, we can use a series of custom functions to balance the dataset by generating the missing intermediate values for every column if required. These new resampled values by default are set to NaN.

In this blog post, we’ll explore a set of custom functions designed to handle unbalanced panel data in Pandas. These functions will allow you to add a pseudodate, resample missing dates, fill missing values, and ensure that your data is correctly aligned for time-based operations.

The `add_pseudodate` function adds a pseudodate column to the dataframe, aligning irregular time periods to a continuous timeline. This is crucial for operations that require a consistent time index.

{% highlight python %}
{% include code_snippets/add_pseudodate.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

This function calculates an offset based on the minimum date in your dataset and maps each date to a corresponding pseudodate, starting from a specified `start_pseudodate`. The result is a new column in your dataframe that maintains temporal continuity.

Once the pseudodate is added, we need to fill in the missing dates. The `resample_missing_pseudodates` function offers two methods (`fast` and `slow`) to resample the data. The `slow` method is the straight forward pandas approach. This can be slow for panel datasets with high N (~500'000) and comparatively small T (~100). The `fast` method manually constructs a new `MultiIndex` with all the required observations and is about 4 times faster than the slow method.

{% include code_snippets/resample_pseudodate.py %}
{% endhighlight %}


Once missing dates are resampled, the next step is to fill in the missing values in the resampled columns.

{% highlight python %}
{% include code_snippets/fill_resampled_columns.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

This function fills the missing values with a specified `fill_value`, ensuring that your dataset is complete and ready for further analysis. These two functions add labels to a new column `resampled` to differentiate between original and resampled data points.

{% highlight python %}
{% include code_snippets/label_resampled.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

The `impute_resampled_dates` function adjusts the pseudodates back to actual dates, maintaining the temporal alignment. Currently (pandas v2.2.2) doesn't support vectorized additions of DateOffsets, i.e. adding a column of DateOffsets to a datetime column. Pandas does allow fast addition of a single DateOffset to a datetime column. The function below partially vectorizes the addition by looping over all unique DateOffsets values. If T is small compared to N, this is much faster than other approaches.

{% highlight python %}
{% include code_snippets/impute_resampled.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

This function ensures that the imputed dates align with the original date values, keeping the data consistent.

Finally, the `remove_pseudodate` function cleans up the dataframe by removing the pseudodate column, leaving you with a balanced dataset ready for analysis.

{% highlight python %}
{% include code_snippets/remove_pseudodate.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

To use these functions, you can chain them together using Pandas’ `pipe` function:

{% highlight python %}
{% include code_snippets/pseudodate_pipeline.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

This pipeline will take your unbalanced panel data, fill in the missing values, and prepare it for time series operations like `.diff()` or `.shift()`.
